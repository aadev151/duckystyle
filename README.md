This website strives to educate users about NFTs by mocking an NFT auction. You start with $10 worth of the auction currency. You can add and withdraw money and receive some currency for watching ads. The money received for watching ads and the initial $10 can only be spent on DFTs (Duck Functional Tokens) form a website collection. The money that were topped up from the "real-life" balance can be spent on anything.
